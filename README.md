# E-Commerce Website

This is an E-commerce website which is implemented using **LARAVEL**. 

The application fetches products from **MYSQL** database 
and product can 

be deleted from the Admin panel. The User panel dispalys available 

products which users can select items and add to their shopping cart, this 

is only possible if user has registered enabling user to sign in. Users can 

also Checkout and Pay on **PAYSTACK.**

# Shopping Cart Package

I originally used the [Gloudemans/LaravelShoppingcart](https://github.com/Crinsane/LaravelShoppingcart) package but it is 

slow to update to the latest versions of Laravel. I now use 

[Darryldecode/LaravelShoppingcart](https://github.com/darryldecode/laravelshoppingcart) which i found easier to implement.
